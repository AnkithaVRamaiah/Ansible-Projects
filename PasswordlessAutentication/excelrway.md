Here's the corrected and expanded version of your explanation for each section:

---

### 1. **Key-based Authentication (Default in Linux)**

Key-based authentication is a more secure way of logging into a server, where you use a **private key** instead of a password. It is the default method for SSH in Linux.

**Login to the server:**
```bash
ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@ipaddress
```
- `key.pem`: This is your private key file.
- `ubuntu`: The username you are logging in as.
- `ipaddress`: The server's IP address.

**Key Components:**
- **Public Key**: Shared with the server and stored in the `authorized_keys` file on the server.
- **Private Key**: Kept on your local machine, used to authenticate your session.

**How it Works:**
- When you attempt to login, SSH uses the **private key** on your local machine to generate a signature.
- The server checks this signature against the **public key** in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file to authenticate you.

**Authorized Keys:**
- On the server, the **public key** is stored in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```
- If you're using **PuTTY** (which doesn’t support `.pem` files directly), you'll need to convert the private key to `.ppk` format using **PuTTYgen**.

### 2. **Passwordless Authentication (Key-based Authentication using SSH Key Generation)**

This method allows logging in without typing a password, using a key pair.

**Steps:**

1. **Generate a Key Pair on Your Local Machine:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```
   This will create a private key (usually named `id_rsa`) and a public key (`id_rsa.pub`).

2. **Copy the Public Key to the Server:**
   - Open the `id_rsa.pub` file and copy its contents.
   - Connect to the server and paste the public key into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
     ```bash
     nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```
   - Make sure the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file has the correct permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```

3. **Login Using the Private Key:**
   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@ipaddress
   ```
   Now, the server will authenticate you using the key pair without needing a password.

### 3. **Password-based Authentication**

Password-based authentication is less secure and generally disabled by default in many modern SSH configurations.

**Steps to Enable Password-based Authentication:**

1. **Modify SSH Configuration on the Server:**
   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   - Find the line `PasswordAuthentication no` and change it to `PasswordAuthentication yes`.

2. **Restart the SSH Service:**
   ```bash
   sudo service ssh restart
   ```

3. **Set Up a New User with a Password:**
   - Add a new user:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd username
     ```
   - Set a password for the user:
     ```bash
     sudo passwd username
     ```

4. **Login with Password:**
   ```bash
   ssh username@ipaddress
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter the password you set in the previous step.

**Additional Notes:**
- For security reasons, it is generally recommended to use key-based authentication over password-based authentication.
- Ensure proper permissions on `.ssh` directories and `authorized_keys` files to prevent unauthorized access.

### 1. **Key-based Authentication in Ansible**

Ansible, by default, uses SSH to connect to managed nodes. Key-based authentication is the recommended and most secure method for Ansible.

**Steps to Use Key-based Authentication with Ansible:**

1. **Generate an SSH key pair (if not already done):**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```
   This creates a pair of SSH keys, typically `id_rsa` (private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (public key).

2. **Copy the public key to the managed nodes:**
   You can use the `ssh-copy-id` tool to copy the public key to the managed nodes:
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@ipaddress
   ```
   This will add the public key to the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

3. **Run Ansible Playbooks Using SSH Keys:**
   Once the public key is installed on the managed nodes, you can run Ansible commands without needing to enter a password:
   ```bash
   ansible all -i inventory -m ping
   ```
   Ansible will use the private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) to authenticate the connection.

   **Note**: If you're using a non-default private key, you can specify it in the Ansible command:
   ```bash
   ansible all -i inventory -m ping --private-key=/path/to/key.pem
   ```

### 2. **Passwordless Authentication in Ansible (via SSH Key)**

Passwordless authentication is essentially key-based authentication, as described in the previous section. Ansible can automatically use the private key for SSH login to managed nodes.

**Steps for Passwordless Authentication:**

- Once the SSH key-based authentication is set up (as described earlier), you can execute Ansible commands or run playbooks without being prompted for a password, as Ansible will use the SSH key to authenticate automatically.

Example:
```bash
ansible all -i inventory -m ping
```
This will run Ansible with passwordless login using the configured SSH keys.

### 3. **Password-based Authentication in Ansible**

If you want to use **password-based authentication** in Ansible (not recommended due to security reasons), you can configure Ansible to use passwords when connecting to the managed nodes. Ansible has options to use `--ask-pass` to prompt for a password during execution or you can define passwords in the `ansible_ssh_pass` variable in the inventory file.

**Steps to Use Password-based Authentication in Ansible:**

1. **Enable Password Authentication on the Managed Nodes:**
   - As mentioned before, modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to allow password authentication (`PasswordAuthentication yes`), then restart the SSH service:
     ```bash
     sudo service ssh restart
     ```

2. **Run Ansible with Password Authentication:**
   - You can use the `--ask-pass` flag to prompt for the password when running Ansible commands:
     ```bash
     ansible all -i inventory -m ping --ask-pass
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can specify the password directly in the inventory file using the `ansible_ssh_pass` variable:
     ```ini
     [webservers]
     ubuntu@ipaddress1 ansible_ssh_pass=yourpassword
     ```

**Note**: Password-based authentication is less secure than key-based authentication and should be avoided when possible.

---

### Summary for Ansible:

- **Key-based Authentication**: The recommended method, using SSH keys to authenticate without a password.
- **Passwordless Authentication**: This is essentially key-based authentication, where you don’t need to enter a password for each login.
- **Password-based Authentication**: Not recommended but supported; you can use `--ask-pass` or the `ansible_ssh_pass` variable in the inventory file.

**Security Considerations**: Key-based authentication is always preferred in Ansible for better security and automation efficiency.
